Checkout this repo in a sibling folder to the BlazorGPT repository.  

The folder structure should look like this:
```
- BlazorGPT
- BlazorGPT.Samples
```

Compile the samples project first. It will copy the semantic plugins from Plugins folder to the BlazorGPT.Web project. It will also copy the DLL file to the BlazorGPT project.

Then compile and run the BlazorGPT.Web project. 


The samples plugins should now be available f√∂r selection in the Plugins list.

Please note that this should be used CAREFULLY in production, lol.
